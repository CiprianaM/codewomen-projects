**Generate a random whole number**  
The `newAdvice()` function needs to generate a random whole number that ranges from 0 to the length of our advice array (in the `advice.js` file).

* The `Math.floor()` function takes in a parameter and rounds the number downward to the nearest integer. For example, if we call `Math.floor(5.7)` it will return 5.
* Use the the `Math.floor()` function and pass in `Math.random()` as a parameter into `Math.floor()`. The `Math.random()` function will generate a random decimal number between 0 and 1.
* To generate random whole numbers, the random decimal that is generated by `Math.random()` needs to be multiplied by a whole number.
* Because we want a random advice from our `advice.js` file, the array index number must exist within this array (otherwise we get an error).
* To solve this problem, we need to multiply `Math.random()` with the length of the advice array. By doing this, we can add or remove as many strings from the array as we like and it will always return a valid number since we are using the `advice.length` method to always get the current length of our array.
* The function can be written as follows:
```
function newAdvice() {
  let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * (advice.length))
}
```
