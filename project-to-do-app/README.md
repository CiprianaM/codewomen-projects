## Project To Do App

***NB: if you want to download this code on your local machine, do not fork it but clone the repo and then create a new repo to use in your own GitHub account, so that it is your own project and not a fork of this project. You can connect a local project to a new, empty GitHub repo [as follows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line). We can do this together during the coding session: it is very good to know this so that you can start a project locally and later on link it with a remote GitHub repo. Please look at the first section of the README from the project_advice_generator and check if you need to change 'remote origin' for the project.***

### The goal of this project is to practice working with Node.js, and learn how to write input to a file

Basic functionality:
We create a project with Node.js and Express and run the server with Nodemon. 

We want the user to be able to add a to do item and save this to a file. The user also has to be able to retrieve the item, to edit it or to delete it.

Additional functionality: the user can search for a to do item.
