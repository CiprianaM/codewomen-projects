This repository is used for the projects that are created for the :muscle: CodeWomen :computer: coding sessions.

For each project, we aim to have different levels: for starters, for students, and for graduates. In the README docs these levels are explained. All CodeWomen can work on any and every level of these projects. As always in programming, there are various ways to build the projects. We will upload some of the possible solutions for every project once the CodeWomen group has worked on the project.
