## Project Learning Git & GitHub

### The goal of this project is to practice working with Git and GitHub and using the terminal for this

We will work with terminal commands such as:  
* pwd
* mkdir
* cd *foldername*
* touch *filename*
* cd ..
* ls

and Git commands such as:  
* git init
* git add .
* git commit -m "*some message*"
* git push
* git status

During the introduction weeks of the bootcamp, the command line, Git and GitHub are discussed. These tools are very important and will become a routine (believe it or not). But like with everything in learning to code: you have to practise.

During the CodeWomen coding session, you can use this material to practise, and as for help from the women developers who are here to coach.
