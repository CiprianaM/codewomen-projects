## Project React Film App

### The goal of this project is to practice working with React, specifically reacting to changes

Basic functionality: we want our app to request data from the Studio Ghibli API (https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com), to show films, locations, film directors etc. 

Additional functionality: search function to search films, locations, and people

Note: the basic CSS code has been created in the `index.css` file. Don't forget to import the css! This is what the app will look like:  

<img src="/project_react_film_app/studio_ghibli_films.png" width="600" />

**Basic setup:**  

1. Create a project folder using `npx create-react-app`
1. Delete all unnecessary code
1. Create a Film component that gets all films from Studio Ghibli
1. Show the films on the screen
